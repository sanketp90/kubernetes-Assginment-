DaemonSets can improve the performance of a Kubernetes cluster by distributing maintenance tasks and support services via deploying Pods across all nodes. 
They are well suited for long-running services like monitoring or log collection. 
Following are some example use cases of DaemonSets:

To run a daemon for cluster storage on each node, such as glusterd and ceph.
To run a daemon for logs collection on each node, such as Fluentd and logstash.
To run a daemon for node monitoring on every note, such as Prometheus Node Exporter, collectd, or Datadog agent.
Depending on the requirement, you can set up multiple DaemonSets for a single type of daemon, with different flags, memory, CPU, etc. that supports multiple configurations and hardware types.

Create a DaemonSet
You can describe a DaemonSet in a YAML file. For example, the daemonset.yaml file below describes a DaemonSet that runs the fluentd-elasticsearch Docker image:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: fluentd-elasticsearch
  namespace: kube-system
  labels:
    k8s-app: fluentd-logging
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      name: fluentd-elasticsearch
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: fluentd-elasticsearch
    spec:
      tolerations:
      # this toleration is to have the daemonset runnable on master nodes
      # remove it if your masters can't run pods
      - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/master
        operator: Exists
        effect: NoSchedule
      containers:
      - name: fluentd-elasticsearch
        image: quay.io/fluentd_elasticsearch/fluentd:v2.5.2
        resources:
          limits:
            memory: 200Mi
          requests:
            cpu: 100m
            memory: 200Mi
        volumeMounts:
        - name: varlog
          mountPath: /var/log
        - name: varlibdockercontainers
          mountPath: /var/lib/docker/containers
          readOnly: true
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30
      volumes:
      - name: varlog
        hostPath:
          path: /var/log
      - name: varlibdockercontainers
        hostPath:
          path: /var/lib/docker/containers

Create a DaemonSet based on the YAML file:
kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/controllers/daemonset.yaml
